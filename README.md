PULA Apprenticeship Take away Assignment

## Instruction to run the code

1. Clone the project.

    git clone git@github.com:BKinya/PULA-Apprenticeship-Take-away-Assignment.git
    
2. Import project into your favourite IDE
    I am assuming you will be running this code on Intellij Idea IDE.
    
    If the IDE complains about JUnit, **package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist** for instance, hover over text highlighted in red, then click on ** alt+enter** and select **add Junit5.x to class path**. This way the errors should go away.

3. To run specific files and see results for each question **Right click** on a specific file
    e.g. Quiz1.java. Select **Run Quiz1.main()**
   
   
   When you run each file output is printed on the console
